# Breast Cancer Classification 
+ Create an interactive dashboard that classifies images of mammograms for breast cancer detection, and to categorize the masses as benign, malignant, or normal.
+ The notebook will encompass data loading and preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch will be leveraged for deep learning tasks, while scikit-learn will be used for data splitting.
+ A dataset containing mammogram images with corresponding masks and labels will be utilized for supervised learning and performance assessment of the models.
+ The expected outcome is a comprehensive workflow for building and evaluating a deep learning-based system for breast cancer detection from mammogram images.
